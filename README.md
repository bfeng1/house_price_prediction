# House Price Prediction

## Objectives
The main objective is to develop a ML model to provide a estimate house price using given training data. 

## Dataset Description

#### [Ames Housing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview) (Kaggle Competition):
This dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset.

#### Datasets Details
* train.csv - the training set
* test.csv - the test set
* data_description.txt - full description of each column, originally prepared by Dean De Cock but lightly edited to match the column names used here

## User Case
* first, install the required libraries
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
* second, inside the project folder, run the python file in the terminal
```python src/main.py```
* Following the instruction on the terminal, provide user inputs for each feature
* Receive the prediction of the house price
